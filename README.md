# Audio Analysis and Classification

### Overview
This project involves the analysis and classification of audio files using machine learning techniques. The goal is to process and classify audio data based on specific features extracted from the audio signals.

### Features
- **Audio Signal Processing**: Extract features like MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), Chroma, and Spectral Contrast from audio files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes the audio data for consistent model input.
- **Classification**: Implements machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks for audio classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for model performance evaluation.

### Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
